Traditional waste management approaches often lack the agility and scalability required to address the growing volume of food waste, particularly in urban environments. This paper explores an integrated strategy combining green and digital technologies-specifically Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT)-to improve the classification, sorting, and conversion of food waste into useful resources. Through a comparative analysis of five core techniques-computer vision, sensor-based monitoring, sensor fusion with machine learning, object detection, and rule-based systems-this study evaluates the strengths and limitations of each approach in real-world applications. The proposed model supports smart sorting for food donation, animal feed, composting, and maggot farming (BSF), offering a scalable solution that aligns with SDG 11, 12, and 13 as well as Indonesia's circular economy goals. Results highlight the importance of multi-sensor data integration and AI-based classification in optimizing food waste management while addressing social, environmental, and economic impacts. The study concludes by recommending a collaborative, adaptive framework that enhances sustainability through technological innovation and stakeholder engagement.},

@article{stephan2025,
   abstract = {Street vendors in developing regions often lack access to portable and affordable cold storage, leading to accelerated food spoilage, financial losses, and health risks. Traditional refrigeration solutions are bulky and costly, while manual freshness assessment is error-prone. This study proposes a smart vending cart integrating IoT sensors and federated learning (FL) to address these challenges, offering real-time environmental monitoring, freshness classification, and privacy-preserving data handling. The smart vending cart incorporates IoT sensors to monitor temperature, humidity, and gas emissions. A Peltier cooling module and a humidifier maintain optimal conditions. Machine learning models classify food freshness, while federated learning ensures vendor privacy by training models locally on each cart. The study explores nine federated learning approaches to train machine learning models across multiple carts without sharing raw data, thus preserving vendor privacy. The Stacking Ensemble approach outperformed all other methods, achieving the highest accuracy, F1-Score, and Cohen’s Kappa (0.99964), with the lowest log loss (0.0022). MetaLearning and Weighted Aggregation also demonstrated high performance but with marginally higher log loss values. Personalized models performed well in heterogeneous data environments but were less effective than ensemble methods. The developed smart vending cart system effectively reduces food spoilage and enhances vendor profitability through automated freshness classification and real-time environmental control. The integration of federated learning ensures privacy, while ensemble techniques improve robustness in resource-constrained settings, offering a scalable solution for street vendors.},

   abstract = {We propose a method for building a simple electronic nose based on commercially available sensors used to sniff in the market and identify spoiled/contaminated meat stocked for sale in butcher shops. Using a metal oxide semiconductor-based electronic nose, we measured the smell signature from two of the most common meat foods (beef and fish) stored at room temperature. Food samples were divided into two groups: fresh beef with decayed fish and fresh fish with decayed beef. The prime objective was to identify the decayed item using the developed electronic nose. Additionally, we tested the electronic nose using three pattern classification algorithms (artificial neural network, support vector machine and k-nearest neighbor), and compared them based on accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The results demonstrate that the k-nearest neighbor algorithm has the highest accuracy. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},
